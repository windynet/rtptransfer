/**
 * A jitter buffer temporarily stores arriving packets in order to minimize delay variations. If packets arrive too late then
 * they are discarded. A jitter buffer may be mis-configured and be either too large or too small.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a jitter buffer is too small then an excessive number of packets may be discarded, which can lead to call quality
 * degradation. If a jitter buffer is too large then the additional delay can lead to conversational difficulty.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A typical jitter buffer configuration is 30mS to 50mS in size. In the case of an adaptive jitter buffer then the maximum size
 * may be set to 100-200mS. Note that if the jitter buffer size exceeds 100mS then the additional delay introduced can lead to
 * conversational difficulty.
